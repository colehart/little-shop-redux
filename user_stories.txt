Iteration 1: (OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES shotgun)

As a user,
when I visit the little shop website,
I see a navigation bar with Merchants, Items and Invoices

when I click on merchants on the nav bar,
I see all the merchants

when I click on the edit button
I see a form where I can edit a merchant name

when I click on the delete button
I see the merchant go away

when I click on "create a new merchant"
I see a form to enter a name and a submit button
